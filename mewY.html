<h2>Who is <span style="color:purple">Mewtwo Y?</span></h2>
<div class="insert">
	<p>According to Azzuriland, Mega Mewtwo Y is one of the Mega Evolutions of Mewtwo, introduced in Pokémon X & Y. It has been veiled in mystery for a long time, first being nicknamed "Mewthree" due to its lack of a name, then being referred to as "Awakened Mewtwo" due to its description on the website for the Genesect and the Legend Awakened movie. </p>

<h2>What is Mewtwo Y physical description?</h2>
<div class="cs">
<p>According to bulbapedia, Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail. On its head it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a sternum replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two. Despite its size, it has phenomenal mental power, and is capable of smashing buildings with a mere thought.</p>
